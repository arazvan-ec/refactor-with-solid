# Multi-Agent Workflow: Criteria

Generate, evaluate, and document architecture decision criteria. Good criteria lead to good architecture choices.

## Usage

```bash
# Full criteria workflow with developer consultation
/workflows:criteria my-feature

# Interactive interview mode (recommended)
/workflows:criteria my-feature --interview

# Quick criteria generation (minimal interaction)
/workflows:criteria my-feature --quick

# Evaluate architecture options against existing criteria
/workflows:criteria my-feature --evaluate

# Review existing criteria
/workflows:criteria my-feature --review
```

## Philosophy

> "No son las arquitecturas las que son buenas o malas, son los criterios los que hacen elegir la arquitectura correcta"

This command answers the critical question: **"Why this architecture and not others?"**

Without explicit criteria:
- Decisions are based on gut feelings or familiarity
- Trade-offs are implicit and undocumented
- Future developers don't understand WHY
- Same debates repeat on future features

With explicit criteria:
- Decisions are objective and traceable
- Trade-offs are explicit and agreed upon
- Future developers can understand and revisit
- Patterns emerge for similar features

## Workflow Modes

### Mode 1: Full Interview (default)

```bash
/workflows:criteria my-feature --interview
```

Conducts a structured interview with the developer:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           ARCHITECTURE CRITERIA INTERVIEW                   ║
║           Feature: my-feature                               ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

I'll help you define the right criteria for choosing the best

|----|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| C1 | Testability | Technical | Critical | TDD project requirement |
| C2 | Team expertise | Team | Critical | 2-week deadline, mid-level team |
| C3 | Development speed | Process | High | Tight deadline |
| C4 | Performance <30s | Technical | High | UX requirement for exports |
| C5 | GDPR compliance | Strategic | High | Business requirement |
| C6 | Maintainability | Technical | Medium | Will be maintained long-term |
| C7 | S3 integration | Technical | Medium | Existing infrastructure |

### Critical Criteria (Must score 4+ or option is rejected)
- C1: Testability
- C2: Team expertise

═══ VALIDATION ═══

Do these criteria look correct? (y/n/edit)
> y

Criteria saved to: .ai/project/features/my-feature/12_architecture_criteria.md

Next steps:
1. Continue with planning: /workflows:plan my-feature
2. Or evaluate options: /workflows:criteria my-feature --evaluate
```

### Mode 2: Evaluate Options

```bash
/workflows:criteria my-feature --evaluate
```

Evaluates architecture options against existing criteria:

```

═══ RESULTS ═══

## Evaluation Matrix

| Criterion (Weight) | A: Simple | B: Queue | C: Event |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Testability (5) | 4 (20) | 4 (20) | 3 (15) |
| Team expertise (5) | 5 (25) | 4 (20) | 2 (10) |
| Dev speed (4) | 5 (20) | 3 (12) | 2 (8) |
| Performance (4) | 2 (8) | 4 (16) | 4 (16) |
| GDPR (4) | 4 (16) | 4 (16) | 4 (16) |
| Maintainability (3) | 4 (12) | 4 (12) | 3 (9) |
| S3 integration (3) | 4 (12) | 4 (12) | 4 (12) |
| **TOTAL** | **113** | **108** | **86** |

## RECOMMENDATION: Option A - Simple Service Layer

**Score**: 113/140 (81%)

### Why Option A?
- Highest total score (113 vs 108 vs 86)
- Meets both Critical criteria (Testability: 4, Team expertise: 5)
- Best for development speed given 2-week deadline

### Why NOT Option B?
- Lower development speed score (3 vs 5)
- Timeline too tight for queue setup and testing
- Would add 3-4 days to implementation

### Why NOT Option C?
- Team expertise score DISQUALIFYING (2 on Critical criterion)
- Team rated themselves 1/5 on CQRS, 2/5 on event-driven
- Would require significant learning curve

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Option A has lower performance score (2 vs B's 4)
- Acceptable because: Large exports are async already, 30s limit is achievable

### Recommendation for Future
- If performance becomes critical, migrate to Option B
- Team should gain queue-based experience on lower-risk features first

## When to Revisit

- [ ] [Condition 2]
```

## Integration with Planning

### Recommended Flow

```bash
# 1. Create feature spec
/workflows:interview feature

# 2. Define architecture criteria (THIS COMMAND)
/workflows:criteria my-feature --interview

# 3. Plan with criteria in mind
/workflows:plan my-feature

# 4. Evaluate architecture options
/workflows:criteria my-feature --evaluate

# 5. Document decision
# (Automatic when evaluation is accepted)
```

### Automatic Triggers

The workflow MAY automatically suggest running criteria when:
- Planning a feature with multiple viable architectures
- Feature touches auth, payment, or security
- Feature is marked as long-term or strategic
- Developer requests architecture comparison

## Best Practices

1. **Always consult**: Don't generate criteria in isolation
2. **Be specific**: "Good performance" is not a criterion; "<100ms p99" is
3. **Limit criteria**: 7-10 max to avoid analysis paralysis
4. **Document trade-offs**: Future devs need to know what was sacrificed
5. **Revisit criteria**: When context changes, criteria may need updating

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Skip consultation | Criteria are assumptions | Always interview stakeholder |
| Too many criteria | Can't decide | Limit to 7-10, prioritize |
| No critical criteria | All options seem equal | Identify must-haves |
| Ignore team context | Theoretically good, practically bad | Weight team expertise |
| One-size-fits-all | Different features need different criteria | Customize per feature |

## SOLID-Rigorous Mode

For features requiring strict SOLID compliance (refactoring, architecture decisions):

```bash
# Add SOLID principles as critical criteria
/workflows:criteria my-feature --solid-rigorous

# Or combine with interview
/workflows:criteria my-feature --interview --solid-rigorous
```

This mode:
1. **Adds 5 SOLID sub-criteria** (S, O, L, I, D) as Critical/High weight
2. **Analyzes existing code** with `/workflow-skill:solid-analyzer` first
3. **Maps violations to patterns** via `core/solid-pattern-matrix.md`
4. **Rejects options** scoring <18/25 on SOLID automatically
5. **Recommends corrective patterns** (Strategy, Decorator, Ports & Adapters, etc.)

### When to Use SOLID-Rigorous

| Scenario | Use `--solid-rigorous`? |
|----------|------------------------|
| Refactoring existing code | **YES** - mandatory |
| Architecture redesign | **YES** - mandatory |
| New feature (greenfield) | Optional (recommended for critical features) |
| Bug fix | No (unless touches architecture) |

### SOLID Evaluation Matrix (added when `--solid-rigorous`)

```
| Criterion | Weight | Option A | Option B |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **C-SOLID-S** | Critical | 5 | 2 ❌ |
| **C-SOLID-O** | Critical | 5 | 3 |
| **C-SOLID-L** | High | 4 | 4 |
| **C-SOLID-I** | High | 5 | 5 |
| **C-SOLID-D** | Critical | 5 | 2 ❌ |
| SOLID Total | | 24/25 ✓ | 16/25 ❌ REJECTED |
```
